ðŸ“š  Is it possible to perform end-to-end computational analysis on multiplexed images with minimal programming experience? Yes, it is! Check out our preprint on ["SPACEc, A Streamlined, Interactive Python Workflow for Multiplexed Image Processing and Analysis"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.29.601349v1) developed by [Yuqi Tan](https://yuqiyuqitan.github.io/), [Tim Kempchen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-kempchen-380b3521a/?originalSubdomain=de), and team, and mentored [Garry Nolan](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/garry-nolan).
