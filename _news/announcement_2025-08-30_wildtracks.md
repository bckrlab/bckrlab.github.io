🇧🇿 **[Visiting WildTracks, Belize](https://www.wildtracksusa.org/):** We are visiting WiltTracks in Belize to work on Manatee animal movement tracking! This is a wildly unique experience where we can combine AI to study animal movement behavior for the rehabilitation and preservation of endangered species. [PS: WildTracks is always looking for volunteers.](https://www.wildtracksusa.org/volunteer)
