## History

WS23/24

- 2024-03-04: New Members! Also looked into the [Harmful Brain Activity Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification).
- 2024-02-26: 3 days left for the Kaggle February challenge on obesity risk prediction! Spoiler: The "weight" feature seems to be quite informative.
- 2024-02-19: Presentation about graph clustering, community detection and visualization.
- 2024-02-12: Started the next Kaggle Playground Challenge on multi-class obesity detection.
- 2024-02-05: Jo√£o Saraiva gave an introduction to processing EEG data in Python.
- 2024-01-15: Agreed upon also working on group projects in addition to the Kaggle challenges. Would be interesting to hear teams present their progress.
- 2024-01-08: Ovarian Cancer Competition is closed - started looking for new competitions like [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1).
- 2023-12-11: Looked into [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Challenges. Also got familiar with pyvips to deal with huge Whole Slide Image PNG files.
- 2023-11-13: Continued to work on the ML tutorials and the ovarian cancer challenge. Apparently, the host plans to add label map annotations, rendering training approaches more efficient.
- 2023-11-06: First Meeting in WS23/24! Welcomed the new members and started to work on the [Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/UBC-OCEAN).
