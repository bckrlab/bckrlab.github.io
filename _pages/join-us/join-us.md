## Contact Us!

👩‍🎓🧑‍🏫👩‍⚕️🙋‍♂️ We are always looking for motivated **PhD students, postdocs, and student assistants** with an interest in developing artificial intelligence and machine learning for real-world problem settings. So, if there are no positions listed above, and you have your own ideas and are excited to work with us, please contact us! We are always happy to support your project proposals or stipends.

## Research Focus

Our focus lies on developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning methods in high-impact application scenarios, e.g., in (bio-)medicine and environmental change.  
In this context, [our projects cover a wide variety of directions and applications](/projects).

## Our Mission and Values

You will join a dynamic and ambitious group of highly motivated highly motivated researchers with a strong global network, including Stanford University, UC San Diego, UNC Chapel Hill, Lund University (Sweden), or McGill University (Canada). This provides you with direct access and collaborations with world-experts in artificial intelligence. machine learning and a wide variety of applied fields. Joining us will give you the unique opportunity to help us shape a highly collaborative, and team-oriented group that aims to impact real-world problem settings through cutting-edge machine learning. We are particularly passionate about methods to understand the underlying processes of complex systems, domain knowledge integration into machine learning methods for accurate modeling, as well as human interaction with existing knowledge. For this, we employ a multitude of approaches ranging from multi-modal learning, graph and geometric deep learning, explainable artificial intelligence, Bayesian modeling, and exceptional model mining.

We are committed create a friendly, supportive, team-oriented, and inclusive work environment with highly motivated colleagues. Diversity across all dimensions is a core value for our lab and a key contributor to our innovative research. Applicants from groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science and machine learning are strongly encouraged to apply.

Our group has a strong commitment to translating research to actionable insights and applications with real-world impact and scalability. This is an excellent environment for candidates who are not only focused on participating in state-of-the-art academic research but are also interested in translating their work in industrial and entrepreneurial avenues.
