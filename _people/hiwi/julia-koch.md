Hey, I am Julia, currently pursuing a master’s degree in computer science, having previously completed a Bachelor’s thesis about Bayesian Linear Regression for Background Knowledge Integration. My academic journey is complemented by my role as a student assistant, where I continue to deepen my expertise and contribute to ongoing research projects.

Beyond my academic endeavors, I enjoy bouldering and spending time with my dogs. Mixing and enjoying cocktails is another passion of mine.
