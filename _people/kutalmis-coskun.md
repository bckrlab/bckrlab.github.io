Hello there! I am Kutalmis, a research assistant and PhD student at Becker Lab, working on the [THEMIS](/projects/2022_themis) project. I like adaptive learning methods (continual/online), challenges brought by non-stationarity, syntactic pattern recognition and the beautiful mathematics of stochastic processes/random walks/Markov chains. 

I am also a fan of metal music \m/, table tennis and an avid cat lover!
