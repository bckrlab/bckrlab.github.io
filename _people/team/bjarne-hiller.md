Moin, I am Bjarne, currently a research assistant and PhD student at Becker Lab. I am working on the [Themis Project](/projects/2022_themis), investigating methods to extract knowledge from and integrate knowledge into complex black box models like deep neural networks. Hopefully, this contributes to making powerful machine learning models more interpretable and justify their application in the medical domain.

In my spare time, I like to play volleyball, develop little silly video games or try to improve my (surprisingly poor) piano skills.
