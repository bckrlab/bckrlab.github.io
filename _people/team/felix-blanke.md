I am Felix, a first-year PhD student at Becker Lab.
I am broadly interested in machine learning projects at the interface to applied mathematics.
Currently, I am working on multiscale generative models in the life science domain.

The source code of my projects is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/felixblanke). For my publications, please refer to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mMTIWJ0AAAAJ).

In my spare time, I enjoy riding my road bike, reading fantasy books, and nerding out about politics.
