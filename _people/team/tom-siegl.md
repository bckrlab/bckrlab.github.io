I am a research assistant and PhD student at Becker Lab, working on the THEMIS project. So far, my work is mostly focused on detailed and interpretable analysis of the predictive performance of machine learning models. I am looking forward to take on various adjacent challenges to explore and realize the potential of machine learning methods in medical settings.

Other than that, I am into wildlife/bird photography and take on a maker project from time to time.
