The project aims to generate biological fingerprints (latent representations) for different patients.
Such fingerprints should be more accurate and comprehensive representations of a patient's biological state than a couple of individual biological measurements.
In practice, this will allow projecting the biological state of a patients over time, forecasting how the biological state of a patient would react to certain treatments or illnesses, and will enable better disease predictions.
