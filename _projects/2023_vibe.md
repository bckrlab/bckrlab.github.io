This project builds a VR sensor collection framework (ViBe) as well as an initial prototype for employing the data for user behavior analysis and prediction. This includes multiple components, including the integration of current VR programming libraries, e.g., Unity and Godot, the implementation of a client library to collect using sensor data based on at least one VR programming language, the development of a server backend to store and process the data, as well as an analysis and machine learning pipeline to evaluate the usability of the collected data.
This will lay the foundation for the prediction of neurogenerative diseases and, ultimately, with the wide-range adoption of VR devices, a global early warning system for cognitive decline.
