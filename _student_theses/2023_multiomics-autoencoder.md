Since the data space grows exponentially with the number of features, the number of samples required to approximately cover its volume soon exceeds what is feasable in real-world applications.
This phenomenon is known as the "Curse of Dimensionality".
Medical data in particular is usually high-dimensional and even multi-modal.
Additionally, gathering of medical data is difficult due to the sensitive nature.
Autoencoders can learn low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data.
This opens up interesting possibilities to reduce data requirements or even to reconstruct missing modalities.
