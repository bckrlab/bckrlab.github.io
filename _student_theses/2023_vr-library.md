Motivated by the "method of loci", i.e., also known as the "mind palace technique", virtual reality can be a great tool to organize information (see for example [Noda](https://www.youtube.com/@noda_tech), or [Softspace](https://soft.space/)).
However, placing new content can be challenging.
This thesis aims to build a novel type of recommender that allows to efficiently place novel content within a virtual reality environment based on existing material.
The thesis will allow you to gain experience with virtual reality headsets like the Meta Quest Pro or the Apple Vision Pro.
