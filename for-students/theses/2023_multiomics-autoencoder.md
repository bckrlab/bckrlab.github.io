    -   title:  Learning Representations of Medical Data with Autoencoders
        desc:   Medical data usually comprises a lot of features per sample, often distributed across multiple data modalities. Therefore, it becomes necessary to reduce the data's dimensionality to keep noise and model complexity minimal. Autoencoders are a powerful unsupervised learning tool to find efficient encodings. In this project, autoencoders will be applied to high-dimensional multiomics and imaging data to convert them into meaningful fingerprints.
